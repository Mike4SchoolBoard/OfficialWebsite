          Our school system tries to keep parents uninformed as to what is being taught to their children. Parents are told that they don’t have a say
          in what is being taught to their children. This is wrong and disrespectful to the time-honored philosophy of “in loco parentis,” which means
          that schools stand in for the parents, not replace the parents. Parents are to direct their children’s future. Public schools should be a
          place of support for parents’ goals not the state’s. We are not a communist or socialist system but a democratic republic one.
