          Education is a public good and benefits all citizens. Thus, the education system should not be a playground for political junkies looking
          for a way to increase their exposure for political gain. There is too much at stake in our children’s future and in the country’s future to
          let political rivalries impact the education system.

        <li>
          The problem with much in education is the underfunding of resources needed to teach and prepare students for their future. There is a
          growing tide directed at extremist doctrines that is draining resources from basic educational services that are needed to become productive
          citizens. Political ideologies should be fought at the legislative levels and the courts, not in our public schools.

          Education should be directed at age-appropriate levels. This includes what is being taught in the classrooms and provided in school
          libraries. Extremist rhetoric should not be tolerated in our public school system. Such mud slinging is harming impressionable students and
          leading to increased anxiety within the student body. Schools should be a place of support and tolerance for children.
        </li>
        <li>
          Parents have the inalienable right to govern their child’s education. School systems are an entity of the government, which by our founding
          documents is to serve and support the public not replace it. Thus, school systems should serve the parents and should not exclude parents
          from their children. The school does not replace the parents, it should reflect the parents.
