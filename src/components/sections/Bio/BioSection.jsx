      <p id="my-career" className="mb-2">
        I have been involved with public schools for over 30 years, not counting my tenure as a substitute. I have been active in middle school all
        the way up to higher education. After receiving my Ph.D. in Education Finance and Law, I began a career as a Senior Researcher and have held
        that position for the last 23 years. My career has included numerous presentations and articles on education budgeting and policy issues and
        have met with legislators and staff and spoken to various groups on the issues of public education.

      <p id="my-family" className="mb-2">
        I also come from a family of educators: my mother retired as a special education teacher, and I have a brother who works as a physical
        education teacher. I believe that I am a qualified candidate to lead Prince William County Public Schools into becoming a leader in providing
        students a high-quality education.
